                                    For my research on laser-ablated mesh and oil-water separation, I authored a thesis titled Exploring Laser-Ablated Mesh for Enhanced Oil-Water Separation: Innovations in Environmental Remediation or Oil-Water Separation Using Laser-Ablated Copper Mesh. This work focused on developing innovative methods for addressing environmental challenges related to oil spills and water purification. <br>

                                    Abstract: <br>
                                    Oil-water separation technologies have proven to be an effective and eco-friendly way to combat oil-water separation problems. The study focuses on the fabrication of copper mesh using laser ablation with different scanning speeds and accessing their effectiveness through a filtration experiment using an olive oil-water mixture. This method involves finding which scanning speed looks to be the most effective for efficient oil-water separation. Although the findings of this experiment contribute to the development of technology for oil-water separation, further research is warranted to explore numerous avenues for future investigation, such as long-term durability.

                                    Normally, when a liquid droplet impacts a surface of a bath of the same liquid, it coalesces. However, if the liquid bath is shaken vertically with sufficient acceleration, the droplets can be made to bounce indefinitely. Bouncing droplets have recently received much attention as examples of self-organizing systems. In order to conduct experiments to study these droplets, we need a way to create drops with a consistent size. In this talk we discuss our efforts to construct an improved droplet on demand (DOD) generator, which overcomes difficulties encountered in earlier designs. By machining parts out of solid plastic on a CNC mill, the new generator design prevents leaks that occurred in the earlier 3D printed model. Next a high speed camera was used to study the dependence of the droplet diameter on nozzle size and on the excitation voltage used to drive the piezo-electric crystal that drives the DOD generator. We also report on other improvements that we made to the shaker system we are using to study bouncing drops including a new leveling mount, programming an accelerometer to display on an LCD, and testing a ramp to be used to move the droplets into the fluid bath. Future areas of research include testing how the oiled ramp might be contributing to droplet diameter and working to create crystals using the DOD generator.</p>

                                    We will use a Python library - PyGame - to create a fun game to simulate farming. The game shares a similar design with existing idle games and features non-traditional animals, weather mechanics, a currency system, power-ups, and our sense of humor. We will use the game development process to experience the entire software development life cycle, including planning, production, testing, and launching. In addition, we plan to use the “agile” software development method throughout the process.

                                    Hundreds of thousands of animals live in animal shelters within the United States and beyond; however, not all animals are adopted at the same rate. People prefer different traits and breeds, which can affect the adoption trends. Using data from the Austin Animal Center Shelter, this project aims to use regression and statistical analysis to discover which traits, breeds, and species are most likely to be adopted, which animals are at a disadvantage, and how to make sure all animals have an equitable outcome.

                                    Abstract: <br>
                                    Oil-water separation technologies have proven to be an effective and eco-friendly way to combat oil-water separation problems. The study focuses on the fabrication of copper mesh using laser ablation with different scanning speeds and accessing their effectiveness through a filtration experiment using an olive oil-water mixture. This method involves finding which scanning speed looks to be the most effective for efficient oil-water separation. Although the findings of this experiment contribute to the development of technology for oil-water separation, further research is warranted to explore numerous avenues for future investigation, such as long-term durability.
