                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I’m Theodora! My love for technology began with a curiosity about how things work and evolved into a career centered around IT and problem-solving. With a background in Physics and Computer Science, I’ve cultivated a strong foundation to tackle complex technical challenges. Whether it’s troubleshooting, streamlining systems, or creating solutions that make life easier, I thrive on making technology work for everyone. <br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond tech, I’m deeply passionate about addressing climate change. I believe we all have a role to play in building a more sustainable future, and I strive to align my skills and actions with this mission. From learning about green technologies to finding ways to reduce waste in daily life, I’m constantly seeking ways to make a positive impact on the environment.<br>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animals have always been a big part of my life. I’m a proud pet parent to two cats, Millie and Yuki, and a lively dog named Kona. Their companionship has fueled my passion for animal welfare and inspired my advocacy for shelters and adoption. Supporting animal shelters and helping animals find loving homes is a cause that truly resonates with me. <br>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m also an art enthusiast with a special love for all things Disney. Art allows me to express creativity and connect with the beauty of the world, while Disney has always been a source of inspiration and happiness. Whether I’m exploring new artistic mediums or re-watching a classic Disney film, these moments bring me immense joy and motivation. <br>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driven and hardworking, I’m always striving for improvement in every area of my life. I believe in constantly learning, growing, and challenging myself to be better. Whether it’s professionally or personally, I’m dedicated to making meaningful contributions and leaving a positive mark on the world.</p>
                        <br>
